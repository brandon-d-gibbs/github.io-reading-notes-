## HTML Video

The first part of our reading covered a thankfully outdated, security issue riddled technology that was used to embed videos into webpages and apps. This technology has since been replaced by HTML 5. 

To use the new HTML 5 video functionality it is actually quite simple. There are a few ways to do this, and several options you can give through attributes to the html 5 `<video>` tag. 

```hmtl5
  <video src = "url/path to the video file goes here" attribute >
  <!-- You can also add multiple video sources between the tags to provide different video format options for various browsers and/or devices. The videos will try to load starting with the first until one is supported that can play.  -->
  <src = "url/pathToVide.mp4" >
  <src = "url/pathToVide.mov" >
  <!-- Then you can have a message to let the user know their device doesn't suport the video -->
  Sorry, your device or browser doesn't support this video.
  <video>
```

## Practical information
There were a few interesting and useful topics here, but I personally have a great deal of experience in the real of SEO.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the art and science of 'optimizing' a website to better show up in search results for topics that you want to be found when users search. This involves everything from meta data, the name of your image and video files, your heading tags content, links (back links to and away from your site), site load times, and much more. There are guidelines set forth by each search engine that help you get the most out of your page to work with ther search algorithims, within their rules.

A good resource for SEO beginners is actually a site called [The Begnner's Guide to SEO] (https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo). Check it out if you want to truly have your site found. 

Gettig people to your site is only the first part of the battle. Keeping them there, clicks, clicking to your other pages, and more will also factor into your SEO `index ranking`. Index ranking is a topic you can explor through the above link on SEO and many other resources.
