## HTML Links CSS Layouts and JS Functions

### HTML Links

```html
    <a href = "URL or file-path to the file / site you want to direct the user to.">Words or image you want to be the clickable link goes here </a>
```
The `\<a\>` tag or `'anchor tag'` is used to create a link. It is not a self-closing tag, so it will require you to wrap your text, img, or element, ending it with `\</a\>`. 

### CSS Layouts
Over the years there have been a lot of additoins to ways to structure your layout in CSS. There are so many methods, approaches, frameworks, etc. 
- Fixed Width
- Fluid (or liquid)
- Grid Layout
- Flexbox
- BootStrap (framework that can be set to use most of these approaches)

### JS functions
Fucntions are reusable blocs of code. You can give a set of instructions that you can later call laver, over and over again with a single line of code after defining what needs to be done within the fucntion.

Example of a funciton:

```js
function functionName (parameters1, parameter2) {
    //code to do something with parameters and/or code to run after the fucnciton call will go here.
}

functionName(Yo, Lo);
```

The bottom line is how to *call* or *run* a funciton. All you need to do is type the name of the function followed by values to put into the parameters inside `( )`.
