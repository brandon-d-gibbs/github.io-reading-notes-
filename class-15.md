## What Google Learned About Teams

This was a great read about team dynamics and the how the individuals and their styles can vary to still get to an optimum and efficient team. Being greter than the sum of its parts if you will. 

Google found that the most successful groups were not determined by all memebers being leaders, less being leaders, made up of all bright or balance intelligence... Instead the most efficient groups where groups with high social and emotional intelligence. Teams that were able to be sensitive to and react well to social temperatures, respect each other, and provide a safe space for everyone to speak up and contribute without fear of ridicule created a higher group IQ and made them more apt to solve issues in a constructve and efficient way.
