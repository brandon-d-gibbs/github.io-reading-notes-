## JavaScript Object Literals and the DOM (Document Object Model)


### Objects
`Object` in Javascript are great for storing multiple data types for something. They are also great for instances where you will need to reuse this object or the data within it. A good example of an object would be a user profile. The User would be the object. The data stored in `key : value` pairs would be information such as:
- username
- email
- birthday
- other user related information needed to be stored based on the type of website or application the user is using.

### The DOM

The `DOM (Document Object Model)` is a model the browswer creates to determine how the HTML should be presented. There are a set of pre-determined rules built into the browser so that your HTML code is displayed in a standard way. We can also manipulate the DOM so that we can *'inject'* data and elements into our document, the order of elements, and more.
